When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I working on a project with a team. So that, the whole team could acquire my changes 
and I can see other's contribution as well.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because I might work with a team and in the repository there might be changes that I don't need.
